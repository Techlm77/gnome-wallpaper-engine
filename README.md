# GNOME Wallpaper Engine

GNOME Wallpaper Engine is a lightweight, GPU-accelerated dynamic wallpaper solution for Linux. It uses GStreamer for video playback and GTK3 to automatically detect your desktop's workarea and scale the video to perfectly fit your screenâ€”giving you a full-featured animated wallpaper experience similar to Wallpaper Engine.

## Features

- **Dynamic Video Wallpaper:** Set a video as your desktop wallpaper.
- **Automatic Scaling:** Detects your monitor's workarea and scales the video to fill your screen.
- **GPU-Accelerated:** Leverages GStreamer for efficient, hardware-accelerated playback.
- **Lightweight:** Designed to have minimal impact on system resources.
- **Wayland Support:** Yes!! You have heard that right XD, this is the first time finally adding wayland support. However... there's no multi monitor support as it only work for single monitor for now.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **GStreamer 1.0** (and necessary plugins, e.g., `gst-plugins-base`, `gst-plugins-good`, etc.)
- **GTK 3**

For Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can install the required packages with:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gst-1.0 gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gir1.2-gst-plugins-base-1.0 gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```
